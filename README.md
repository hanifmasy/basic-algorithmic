You can achieve this by finding the prime numbers between 0 and 30, and then using a combination of these primes to represent the capacities of the containers. Here's a Python code that accomplishes this task:

```python
import itertools

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def get_prime_numbers(limit):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, limit):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return primes

def min_containers(X):
    primes = get_prime_numbers(30)
    min_total_containers = float('inf')
    min_containers = None

    for combination in itertools.product(range(X+1), repeat=len(primes)):
        total_containers = sum(combination)
        total_liters = sum(c * p for c, p in zip(combination, primes))
        if total_liters == X and total_containers < min_total_containers:
            min_total_containers = total_containers
            min_containers = combination

    return min_containers

# Example usage:
X = 100
containers = min_containers(X)
primes = get_prime_numbers(30)
for i, container_count in enumerate(containers):
    if container_count > 0:
        print(f"Container {primes[i]} = {container_count} container(s)")
```

This code will find the combination of containers with prime capacities that require the fewest total containers to hold X liters of liquid. You can adjust the value of X as needed.


This method applies a brute force approach combined with combinatorial optimization techniques to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the methodology:

1. **Prime Number Generation**: The first step involves generating prime numbers up to a certain limit. This is done using a function (`get_prime_numbers`) that iterates through numbers and checks whether each one is prime. This is an essential step as the problem specifically involves using prime capacities for the containers.

2. **Brute Force Combination**: The code then utilizes itertools to generate combinations of different quantities of containers for each prime capacity. It iterates through all possible combinations of containers and calculates the total number of containers and total liters for each combination.

3. **Optimization**: During the iteration, it keeps track of the combination that satisfies the given condition (total liters equal to X) and requires the fewest total containers. This involves maintaining variables to store the minimum total containers and the corresponding combination.

4. **Output**: Finally, it returns the combination of containers that meets the criteria (total liters equal to X) with the minimum total containers.

This method is suitable for relatively small problem sizes, as the brute force approach becomes less efficient as the problem scales. However, for the given problem constraints, the number of possible combinations remains manageable. Overall, this method combines basic mathematical principles (prime numbers) with algorithmic techniques (brute force and combinatorial optimization) to solve the problem efficiently.
